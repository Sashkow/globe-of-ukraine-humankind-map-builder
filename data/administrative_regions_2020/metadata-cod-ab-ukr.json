    "caveats": "The Ukrainian government has not fully implemented its new administrative structure reforms in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea [UA01] and Sevastopol [UA85]. Consequently, 31 ADM4 features within the Sevastopol ADM3 polygon retain P-codes that do not correctly conform to [UA85]. This will be rectified in a COD-AB update once the government has regained control of the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nNote that limitations of the Ukrainian-to-Russian transliteration method mean that more than one Ukrainian name may be represented by a single Russian feature name.\n\nNote that Ukraine COD data incorrectly uses 'UA' instead of 'UK' in Ukrainian language name fields.  For instance, \"Admin1_UA\" should be \"Admin1_UK\".\n\nAs of January 2025, there are no legislative regulations that officially define the renaming of hromadas following the renaming of their capitals. Technically, such hromadas still retain their old names, even though their capitals now have new ones. However, the draft law (https://mtu.gov.ua/news/36152.html) has already been prepared to address this collision. It is expected that the hromadas' names will soon be aligned with the new names of their capitals. Therefore, the supposed new names of hromadas are reflected in the reference table.\n\n\n\n",
